# WindowsGSM.Satisfactory
ðŸ§©WindowsGSM plugin that provides Satisfactory Dedicated server support!

# The Game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/

# Requirements
WindowsGSM >= 1.21.0

# Save Files
The save files are located in the host folder %LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\Savegames\server

# Config
After starting the server, the first client to connect to the server will be able to configure it ingame.

# Installation
  1. Download the latest release
  2. Move Satisfactory.cs folder to plugins folder
  3. Click [RELOAD PLUGINS] button or restart WindowsGSM

# Known Issues
FactoryServer.exe launches a new window by itself. This means that FactoryServer's window can be hidden, but the window it spawns cannot. Seeing as the dedicated server was released only 24 hours ago at this time, I am confident that this will be fixed internally.
